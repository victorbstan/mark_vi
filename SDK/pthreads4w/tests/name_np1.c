 * Description:
 * Create a thread and give it a name.
 *
 * The MSVC version should display the thread name in the MSVS debugger.
 * Confirmed for MSVS10 Express:
 *
 *      VCExpress name_np1.exe /debugexe
 *
 * did indeed display the thread name in the trace output.
 *
 * Depends on API functions:
 *      pthread_create
 *      pthread_join
 *      pthread_self
 *      pthread_getname_np
 *      pthread_setname_np
 *      pthread_barrier_init
 *      pthread_barrier_wait
