     /*
      * ------------------------------------------------------
      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      Threads created with 'attr' will run on the stack
      *      starting at 'stackaddr'.
      *      Stack must be at least PTHREAD_STACK_MIN bytes.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      attr
      *              pointer to an instance of pthread_attr_t
      *
      *      stackaddr
      *              the address of the stack to use
      *
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      Threads created with 'attr' will run on the stack
      *      starting at 'stackaddr'.
      *      Stack must be at least PTHREAD_STACK_MIN bytes.
      *
      *      NOTES:
      *              1)      Function supported only if this macro is
      *                      defined:
      *
      *                              _POSIX_THREAD_ATTR_STACKADDR
      *
      *              2)      Create only one thread for each stack
      *                      address..
      *
      *              3)      Ensure that stackaddr is aligned.
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully set stack address,
      *              EINVAL          'attr' is invalid
      *              ENOSYS          function not supported
